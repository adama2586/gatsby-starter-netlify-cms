**INGREDIENTS**


**For sauce:**

zest from one orange, plus 1/2 cup fresh orange juice (about 2 naval oranges)

* 1 tbsp. soy sauce
* 1 tbsp. packed brown sugar
* 1 tbsp. white vinegar


2 tbsp. 

* chicken stock tsp. 
* 1tsp freshly grated ginger
* 1 tsp. cornstarch



For chicken:

3 tbsp. cornstarch
4 large egg whites
1 lb. boneless chicken thighs, cut into in 1-inch pieces
1 c. all purpose flour
1/2 tsp. baking powder
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
3 to 4 cups canola oil, for frying
Sliced scallions, for garnish
cooked rice, for serving

**DIRECTIONS**

1. **Make the sauce:** Cook orange zest and juice, soy sauce, sugar, vinegar, stock, and ginger in a medium saucepan over low heat just until bubbling. Whisk in cornstarch. Cook until sauce thickens,  5 to 6 minutes.
2. **Make the chicken:** Whisk together 2 tablespoons cornstarch and egg whites in a bowl until frothy. Add chicken and let sit, 5 minutes. In a second  bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, remaining tablespoon cornstarch. Season with salt and pepper. 
3. **Line a rimmed baking sheet with paper towels.** Remove chicken pieces, one at a time (letting excess egg white to drip off), and roll in flour mixture until coated, leave pieces in flour mixture as you work.
4. **Heat oil in a wok or large Dutch oven over medium heat until temperature reaches 350Â°F on an instant read thermometer.** Cook chicken, in batches, until golden brown and cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to prepared baking sheet to drain. Season with salt and pepper.
5. **Add chicken to sauce and gently toss to coat.** Serve garnished with scallions. and rice alongside.
