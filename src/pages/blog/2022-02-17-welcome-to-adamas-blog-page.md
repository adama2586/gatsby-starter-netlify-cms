**Youssou N’Dour**, (born October 1, 1959, [Dakar](https://www.britannica.com/place/Dakar), Senegal), Senegalese singer known for his extraordinary vocal range and for introducing international audiences to *mbalax*—a Senegalese [popular music](https://www.britannica.com/art/popular-music) style that blends [Wolof](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Wolof) traditional instrumental and vocal forms primarily with Cuban and other Latin American popular [genres](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/genres). He served as [Senegal’s](https://www.britannica.com/place/Senegal) minister for [culture](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/culture) and tourism (2012–13).

N’Dour was raised in a devout [Sufi](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sufism) Muslim household by a mother who was of [Tukulor](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tukulor) descent and a carrier of the bardic [griot](https://www.britannica.com/art/griot) tradition and a father who was [Serer](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Serer). Like most other residents of Dakar since the mid-20th century, however, N’Dour grew up culturally and linguistically Wolof. He began [singing](https://www.britannica.com/art/singing) at neighbourhood religious festivities when he was about 12 years old, and he and his band were performing outside various dance clubs in Dakar by the time he was in his early teens. (He was too young to play legally inside the clubs.) At age 16 N’Dour joined the regionally popular Star Band de Dakar. That group, with its incorporation of the Senegalese *tama* (talking drum) and Wolof and [Malinke](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Malinke) songs into the popular music [repertoire](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/repertoire), was a pioneer of the music [genre](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/genre) that eventually became known as *mbalax*.
